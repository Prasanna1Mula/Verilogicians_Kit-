## 📌 About the Project

**Verilogians_kit** is a thoughtfully curated collection of reusable Verilog modules, simulation testbenches, and FPGA-friendly code blocks designed to support learners, hobbyists, and embedded system developers. This is not just a project — it's a practical learning space for mastering digital electronics through HDL.
